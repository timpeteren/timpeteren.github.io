Setting up Github Pages one can only admire the efficiency and ease of getting started.

Thank you very much [Stian Strysse](https://learningbydoing.cloud) for helping me!

Adopting and getting more familiar with the DevOps methodology using GitHub and Jenkins feels totally right.
Working with version control and markdown is smooth.
There are so many helpful tools.
With Visual Studio code there are many great extensions.
All this to make documentation easier, but also using one IDE for documentation, scripting and coding.

Happy dayz!
