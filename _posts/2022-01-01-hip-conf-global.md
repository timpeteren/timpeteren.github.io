Last year, December 1-2, 2021, I attended the HIP Global conference.

Things being what they are, this conference was hosted virtually.
I admire the speakers for still being able to deliver a lot of awesome sessions, on a variety of interesting topics, all connected to identity.
Please head over to the [Hybrid Identity Protection conference webpage](https://www.hipconf.com/).
Here you can also find all prior conference talks at their [Discover](https://www.hipconf.com/discover/) page.
Alternatively, most HIP sessions can be found on Youtube, by following the link below.

A great big thanks to [Semperis](https://www.semperis.com/) for being the sponsor of the conference.

A little plug; on their [Semperis Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCycrWXhxOTaUQ0sidlyN9SA/videos) you will find a great amount of awesome video content, including videos from prior HIP conferences.

Unsurprisingly I got into this conference because of my long-standing admiration of John Craddock.
Having attended a pre-conference class with him in the early days of [NIC (Nordic Infrastructure Conference)](https://www.nicconf.com/), and prior to that multiple TechEd (old Ignite) sessions, he has become a must-see to me (I see that he is scheduled to host a pre-conference session at this years NIC, May 31!).

John did not disappoint on this edition of HIP either and his closing keynote presentation: **Will Decentralized Identities and Verifiable Credentials Become the Future of Identity?** hit home for me.
As a blockchain enthusiast I was delighted to be updated on how ledger technology on blockchain works today, and how it may be of use in the future.
I should also note that using ledgers for storing verifiable credentials does not have to include neither Bitcoin nor blockchain as a whole.
However, with my area of specialty being identity, considering how identities may be handled in the future is truly intriguing.

As the conference was on an Eastern Time schedule I wasn't able to check out any of the sessions live.
In fact, it took me a couple of weeks before I really got into the sessions but from there it didn't take long before I had viewed them all, with the exception of one or two.

The first session I watched was Sander Berkouwer's **Windows Hello for Business Hybrid Access: How Does It Work Under the Covers?** as I was currently troubleshooting a project having issues with WHfB.
The session was very enlightening, both from a theoretical and practical perspective.
Getting access to real-life experience from seasoned IT veterans is incredibly valuable.

In the same vain, Joe Kaplan's **Taking a Large Organization Passwordless: Completing the Journey**, a follow-up from last years **Taking a Large Organization Passwordless**, was a good insight into how a big company like Accenture (currently employs more than 650.000 people) thinks and acts when it comes to passwordless.

I also *earned* a HIP **Certificate of completion**, so I'd better parade that here, now that I have the chance :smile:

So much good content, and don't let yourself be fooled by som of the session titles, they don't all look that exciting.
Personally I was always happy I had chimed in to the various sessions, because there were always topics being discussed, or show-cased, that I learned a thing or two from.

Happy HIP-ing! :smiley:
