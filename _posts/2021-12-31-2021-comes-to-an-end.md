A full pandemic year ends.

Who knows what 2022 will bring?
Surely more of what we saw in 2021.

Conditioned to be positive I will focus on the brightest experiences.
Attitude matters!

Fortunately, the promise of 2022 looks good, and we can only hope it lives up to it.

Having recently gotten started on the #ATCP (Azure Technical Contributor Program) I want to get into the habit of documenting more frequently.
It's a lot of work, but it's also very rewarding when the result pans out.

Additionally, there are times where it's just as useful to write down past experiences to keep them archived and avoid losing the important details.
There are so many different, and interesting, situations, and challenges, we come across in our line of business.

Writing for the sake of writing isn't a bad thing either.
See, it's all about attitude :-)

2022, here we come!
